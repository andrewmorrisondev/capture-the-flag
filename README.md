# Capture the Flag - Online Board Game

Welcome to the online version of the classic board game, Capture the Flag. This project is a web-based, interactive game that allows two players to compete in real-time, employing strategy and foresight to capture the opponent's flag while defending their own. Developed with React and Socket.IO, this game brings the beloved tabletop experience to your screen, featuring a dynamic interface and real-time gameplay.

## How to Play

Each player starts with a flag and a set of pieces on their side of the board. The objective is to capture the opponent's flag and return it to your base.
